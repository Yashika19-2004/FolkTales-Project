##  What is FolkTales?

FolkTales is an open, community-powered web application designed to digitally preserve and share local Indian **stories**, **proverbs**, and **mythological tales**.  
It empowers users to contribute **in their native language**, using **voice or text**, and leverages **AI** to categorize, translate, and bring stories to life.

##  Our Mission

To protect India's cultural memory and oral traditions by providing an AI-enabled storytelling platform for villagers, students, researchers, and the general public.
